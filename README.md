## Skyline Extraction for Navigation

**By Zardoua Yassir, PhD in Computer Vision (yassirzardoua@gmail.com)**

This code implements a robust dynamic programming algorithm for extracting the skyline in images, particularly for navigation purposes. The algorithm is inspired by the research presented in the paper:

*A robust dynamic programming algorithm to extract skyline in images for navigation* by [Liu et al., Comp. Vis. Image Understanding 96 (2004)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865504002302?casa_token=qoOQeeQm8eIAAAAA:lepXxF98faAiFm0nDuCx0tXb8F6DmrN8zCt-tOSjklpBL2tf1NeThBQaVKFk9Jwy7EjfzsZe_os).

**Note:**
I substituted the Dynamic Programming (DP) by the line fitting technique proposed in [Jeong et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11045-018-0602-4#Ack1). This modification is justified by the linearity assumption adopted in the maritime literature.
